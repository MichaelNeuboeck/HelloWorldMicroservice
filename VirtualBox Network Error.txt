If you get the dreaded VERR_INTNET_FLT_IF_NOT_FOUND error:

Open Network and Sharing Center and go to the Change adapter settings in the sidebar.
Right-click on the host-only adapter in the list of adapters and then:
Configure button ->
Driver tab ->
Update driver button.
Select Browse my computer ...
In the next dialog select Let me pick ....
You should see the list with just host-only driver in it.
Select it and click next.
After the driver is updated, please try using host-only network in a VM again.
